# Guess the Programming Language

## All about the project

The "Programming Language Hangman with React + Vite" project is a modern twist on the classic word-guessing game, designed to challenge players' knowledge of programming languages. Leveraging the power of React for frontend development and Vite for fast and efficient bundling, this project offers an immersive and interactive gameplay experience while reinforcing programming language recognition skills.

## Gameplay Mechanism

> `Word Selection`: Randomly select a programming language name from a predefined list or database.

> `Guessing Mechanism`: Allow players to guess letters one at a time through an interactive interface. Incorrect guesses deduct from available attempts.

> `Win/Loss Conditions`: Declare victory if the player guesses the programming language within a specified number of attempts. End the game if the attempts exceed the maximum limit.
